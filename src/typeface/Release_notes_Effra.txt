Change log:
- v3.000: 
    - Converted to variable fonts.
    - Extended weight range from Hairline to Black, with adjustments made to all weights for family harmony.
        There is no 1:1 match in value for the static fonts of the original Effra (v2.031) to Effra v3.000.
        The closest static weight matches for the original (v2.031) in v3.000 are:
            v2.031           v3.000
            Effra Light   -> Effra Thin
            Effra Regular -> Effra Regular
            Effra Medium  -> Effra SemiBold
            Effra Bold    -> Effra Bold
            Effra Heavy   -> Effra XBold
        The original (v2.031) weights (but not their metrics) can be matched exactly in the variable font:
            Effra Light   -> Effra VF wght=245
            Effra Regular -> Effra VF wght=435
            Effra Medium  -> Effra VF wght=581
            Effra Bold    -> Effra VF wght=700
            Effra Heavy   -> Effra VF wght=781
